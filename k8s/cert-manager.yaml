# Cert-Manager Configuration for Let's Encrypt TLS Certificates
# 
# Prerequisites:
# - cert-manager installed: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/
#   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.0/cert-manager.yaml
#
# This manifest creates:
# 1. ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt Staging (for testing, avoid rate limits)
# 2. ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt Production (for real certificates)

---
# Let's Encrypt Staging ClusterIssuer (use for testing)
# Staging has higher rate limits but produces untrusted certificates
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: admin@mandara-fitness.com  # Change to your email
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx

---
# Let's Encrypt Production ClusterIssuer (use for real deployments)
# Production has strict rate limits (50 certs/3 hours per domain)
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: admin@mandara-fitness.com  # Change to your email
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx

# Alternative: DNS01 solver (for wildcard certificates and DNS validation)
# Requires DNS provider integration (example: Route53, Cloudflare, etc.)
# Uncomment and configure if needed
#
# apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
# kind: ClusterIssuer
# metadata:
#   name: letsencrypt-dns
# spec:

#       name: letsencrypt-dns-key
#     solvers:
#       - dns01:
#           route53:  # Example: AWS Route53
#             region: us-east-1
#             accessKeyID: XXXX
#             secretAccessKeySecretRef:
#               name: route53-credentials
